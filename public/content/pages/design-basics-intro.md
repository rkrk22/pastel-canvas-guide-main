There are many different schemes on "design principles", you may have come across them many times but didn't know how to apply them.

Take a look at one of these schemes:

[Basic design principles](/read/basic-design-principles)

But it's important to realize that these schemes will be useless if you don't know how to apply them in practice.

I have a slightly different approach. Because all these schemes are very difficult to apply, people often get lost and don't know which principle to use.

It is necessary to understand from the beginning what task we set for ourselves. You can break the rules of design in order to solve a task. We will look at all the examples later.

For example, if a design principle tells us that using the same objects in a composition is bad, I say it depends on the task, and depends on how we use it, in what quantity, color, etc.
