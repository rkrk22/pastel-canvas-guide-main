# Show your artwork

I know, for some artists, this is the most difficult part. Many beginners don't show their work or post it on social media. I know this because I've been doing the same thing. When it comes to portfolio sites, Behance or Artstation, it's more about posting well selected and designed works. But there are many other places where you can post your sketches and processes. This has the additional advantage that you can always see your progress.

It's even better when you're posting in a community of supportive artists. The fastest growth I've experienced is working in a team of artists where I can always consult, see how others are working, and additionally this context motivates me to grow.

In addition to suggesting everyone to start a blog, I also suggest posting your artwork in our **Discord Chat** in the relevant section. That way we can learn from each other, support each other, write feedback, and I'll know what's relevant to you in terms of content for the book. In the future, I'd like to make a separate site with a gallery of your work, where **employers** can search for artists for their projects.
