A lot of different kinds of graphics can match game art, from pixel art to 2D and 3D graphics. In the book I would share more from the point of view of what I was doing and share my personal experience, and for all the time I have been working, more than 10 years in the industry, I have managed to work in almost all directions, except for pixel art.

The basic principles of good visuals in games are suitable for all types of graphics. Knowledge of composition and design will help you to work both in pixel graphics and in hyper-casual, understanding the basics of animation will help you to understand more physics and build believable dynamic scenes. Working with color, will help you as in the design of the interface and just as in the design of the environment and characters.

In the book, I will sometimes use industry-specific terms. For easier reference, I have collected them all on a separate page. To find a term, press CTRL+F and type the word you need:

To summarize and visualize what game art is, what I would do is to type in Pinterest or Behance: in the search bar, "Game Art". The results would show different types of game art.

Set up a quick search for you:

## Game art is not just about drawing

It's more than just pretty pictures and models. It's a complex mix of art and technology, designed to bring the virtual world to life and make it part of the player's experience.

Let's break it down in order:

1. **Design:** At the heart of game art is design. It can be characters, objects, landscapes, architecture, and more. Design determines how the game will look and feel.
2. **Modeling and Texturing:** Artists create 3D models using tools and techniques to give them the look they want, often based on a concept. They then apply textures to the models, creating details such as skin or fabric textures and adding effects.
3. **Animation:** Animation gives motion and life to models. From a character walking to an explosion, animation gives life to static objects.
4. **Lighting and Effects:** Artists also work on lighting and special effects. These elements create the mood and atmosphere of the game, making the world more exciting and realistic.
5. **Combining with Gameplay:** Game art doesn't work as an independent piece of art. It must be closely related to gameplay, mechanics, and story. In most cases, to create good art, you need to understand the gameplay of the game.
6. **Innovation:** Game industry constantly changing and innovating. Utilizing the latest VR, AR and AI technologies opens up new horizons for artists and developers.
7. **GUI:** The game interface is an important element of game art that determines how the player will interact with the game. A good interface should not only be functional, but also attractive and intuitive for the user.

In conclusion, game art is a complex and multi-leveled concept that combines art, technology, and game design philosophy. It is not just a visual component; it is the soul of the game that helps create a unique and unforgettable experience for the player.
