## **What is Game Art Guidebook**

The Game Art Guidebook is a comprehensive knowledge base on creating game art. It covers various topics, including drawing, shading, rendering, game user interface, and animation, as well as the use of software like Photoshop. This guidebook is perfect for anyone interested in creating game art, whether they are beginners or experienced artists looking to improve their skills.

The guidebook features a range of resources, such as video tutorials, custom brushes, and updatable content to help learners master the techniques and create stunning game art.

## **Some of the key features you can expect to receive include:**

1. Video tutorials are also available in addition to the written content of the book. These short videos demonstrate the techniques and concepts discussed in the book, providing learners with a great visual aid and allowing them to see the techniques being applied in real-time.
2. Brushes: you will receive a set of custom brushes specifically designed for use with the techniques outlined in the book. These brushes give you a head start in creating your own game art and save you time when setting up your own brush library.
3. Rather than a static PDF file, you will have access to upgradable content. This means that as new features are released in the art tools used in the game industry, I will update the tutorials to include them. This way, you can be sure that you are always up-to-date with the latest trends and techniques in the industry. With this book, you will not only be learning the skills you need to succeed today but also preparing for the future.
4. The guidebook not only covers technical skills but also important business-related topics like working with clients, freelancing, pricing, and how to sell game art. This makes it a valuable resource for artists looking to improve their skills and turn their passion into a career.

I hope these features will help you get the most out of the book and achieve your goals in creating stunning game art. Thank you again for your interest, and I look forward to seeing your progress!
