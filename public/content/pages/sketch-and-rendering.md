## The first sketch

Usually, I start with a very **rough** and quick sketch, in order to decide on the angle and the general idea.

At this step, it is enough to show the composition of **large**, **medium** and **small** masses.

This approach saves the "blank page" problem when you can't start drawing for a long time.

Focus on generating quick ideas, don't chase quality, accuracy of lines at this stage. Allow yourself to "float" ideas, which can be converted into a set of sketches. Finalize them later.

## Detailed sketch

Now you can draw more detailed elements of geometry, add objects, and at the same time keep looking for more references.

## Color sketch

At this point it is important to see how it will look with light and shadows, and after adding shadows the impression may change, based on this it is sometimes worthwhile to modify the sketch slightly.

## Detail drawing

If the sketch in color is approved, you can start working on details. In some areas I have already started to draw the texture.

## Update based on feedback 

Changed the geometry and added some details

## Final result

The entire Pipeline can be applied to any artwork. But, you don't have to stick to only one clear sequence of actions. As an exercise, try sometimes making sketches not in linework but in color right away. Or the opposite, pay more attention to the sketch, as if you were going to post only the sketch as a separate work for a portfolio with very neat and clean lines.
