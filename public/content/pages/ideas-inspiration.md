Now I'm going to share my approach to finding ideas. For me, it's a **never-ending process**. I am very often looking for references when I have free time, I like to discover new styles and try something out right away. As a result, I have many folders and pins on Pinterest, saved selections on other sites, **tones of screenshots and sketches**. And when I get to work, I usually already have a **large volume of prep work in progress.**

## Gather references / mood board

When you've decided on a basic task, start gathering references.

I show you an example of working on a diorama concept for **The Loóna app**. Mood board - for general understanding of color scheme, atmosphere and overall style.

Next, more detailed reference gathering. For a detailed search for ideas. Think about what objects, scenery, and building geometry will be, to find interesting designs.

Along with photos of the real place in **Morocco**, I got some references for the rendering style. I was first inspired by the artworks of the [Art Director](https://www.artstation.com/masterhalfling) of this project and [Anya Jo Elvidge.](https://www.artstation.com/anyatheartist)

On this board at the link below, I've collected ideas for perhaps you could use if you decide to make your own diorama concept:

## Tools for working with references

- [**PureRef**](https://www.pureref.com/)
- [**miro.com**](http://miro.com/)
- [**fabrie.com**](https://www.fabrie.com/)

What app to use for references is not so important, proceed from what is more useful for a specific case. It is also a good idea to create mood board and references at once in Photoshop document.

I mostly prefer to use Miro. This program provides more options for working with graphics and text, as well as allows you to organize information quickly and easily. For example, I can create a board with notes and colored labels to structure information easily and quickly find the items I need. In addition, Miro has a wide range of drawing and design tools, which makes the process of creating references more creative and interesting.

While working on this book, I used Miro as well:

**And perhaps one of the main advantages of apps like Miro: you can copy the link to the board and immediately send it to the client, without wasting time on sending files.**
