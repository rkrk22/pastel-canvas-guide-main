You've probably seen the lessons about large, medium, and small shapes many times. This is a foundation that we will return to often.

We'll start with simple shapes and schemes. But then there will be more complex examples, and I will show how it works not only in the design of objects, but also when drawing large scenes

We will learn to avoid the same repetitive forms. Except where it will solve a specific problem.

The main idea is not just to follow this rule according to a scheme. It is important to constantly think about what objects you want to emphasize, where to emphasize contrast and where to guide the viewer's eye.

💡 In design, it is important to distinguish between the essential and the non-essential. You may have heard the phrase: "If everyone is unique, then no one is unique." In our case, if all shapes are the same, they merge into one big shape.

In the examples below, you can clearly see the difference between chaos and composition with accents

Chaos of objects. There are no accents and all the objects merge into one big mass. Such a composition is difficult to look at because it takes more energy from the viewer

A more structured composition. With the same number of objects, some smaller objects merge with larger ones and common shapes are formed

Our eye is always striving to notice contrasts. These "empty" areas make smaller objects appear more contrasting

At first we notice large shapes and gradually move on to smaller ones. The easier it is for the eye to "float" through the contrasts, the more we like the composition

💡 We understand the principles of design from nature, where everything is in balance. Therefore, this topic is fundamental. It can be applied to all areas of life.
